Memory Tool Module - Persistent Curated Memory

Provides bounded, file-backed memory that persists across sessions. Two stores:
  - MEMORY.md: agent's personal notes and observations (environment facts, project
    conventions, tool quirks, things learned)
  - USER.md: what the agent knows about the user (preferences, communication style,
    expectations, workflow habits)

Both are injected into the system prompt as a frozen snapshot at session start.
Mid-session writes update files on disk immediately (durable) but do NOT change
the system prompt -- this preserves the prefix cache for the entire session.
The snapshot refreshes on the next session start.

Entry delimiter: § (section sign). Entries can be multiline.
Character limits (not tokens) because char counts are model-independent.

Design:
- Single `memory` tool with action parameter: add, replace, remove, read
- replace/remove use short unique substring matching (not full text or IDs)
- Behavioral guidance lives in the tool schema description
- Frozen snapshot pattern: system prompt is stable, tool responses show live state

#
# Patterns live in ``tools/threat_patterns.py`` — the single source of truth
# shared with the context-file scanner and the tool-result delimiter system.
# Memory uses the "strict" scope (broadest pattern set) because:
#  - memory entries are user-curated; the user can rewrite a flagged entry
#  - memory enters the system prompt as a FROZEN snapshot, so a poisoned
#    entry persists for the entire session and across sessions until
#    explicitly removed.

        1. Round-trip mismatch — re-parsing and re-serializing the file
           doesn't produce identical bytes (rare; would catch oddly-encoded
           delimiters).
        2. Entry-size overflow — any single parsed entry exceeds the
           store's whole-file char limit. The tool budgets the ENTIRE store
           against that limit; no single tool-written entry can exceed it.
           When we see one entry larger than the limit, an external writer
           (patch tool, shell append, manual edit, sister session) appended
           free-form content into what the tool will treat as one entry.
           Flushing would then truncate that entry to the model's new
           content, discarding the appended bytes — issue #26045.
